Here is the list of some established lock ordering.

In this list, A -> B means that you can have A.Lock() then B.Lock(), not the opposite.

jetStream -> jsAccount -> Server -> client -> Account

jetStream -> jsAccount -> stream -> consumer

A lock to protect jetstream account's usage has been introduced: jsAccount.usageMu.
This lock is independent and can be invoked under any other lock: jsAccount -> jsa.usageMu, stream -> jsa.usageMu, etc...
