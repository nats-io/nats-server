    # Name for an HTTP cookie, that if present will be used as a client JWT.
    # If the client specifies a JWT in the CONNECT protocol, this option is ignored.
    # The cookie should be set by the HTTP server as described [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#restrict_access_to_cookies).
    # This setting is useful when generating NATS `Bearer` client JWTs as the
    # result of some authentication mechanism. The HTTP server after correct
    # authentication can issue a JWT for the user, that is set securely preventing
    # access by unintended scripts. Note these JWTs must be [NATS JWTs](https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/jwt).

    # See below to know what is the normal way of limiting websocket clients
    # to specific users.
    # If there are no users specified in the configuration, this simple authorization
    # block allows you to override the values that would be configured in the
    # equivalent block in the main section.

    #     # and password to be able to connect.

    #     # password: "my_password"
    #
    #     # If this is specified, the password field in the CONNECT has to
    #     # match this token.
    #     # token: "my_token"
    #
    #     # This overrides the main's authorization timeout. For consistency
    #     # with the main's authorization configuration block, this is expressed
    #     # as a number of seconds.
